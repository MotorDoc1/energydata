# energydata
#
# Contains a number of EIA.gov and US DOE databases.  Additionally, trans.mdb is provided from a continuous monitoring device
# used at the revenue meter of a manufacturing facility.  The data is collected via an EMPATH ECMS-1 continuous monitoring system
# which is an electrical signature analyzer.  The database retains a repository of just energy data snapshots every 15 minutes with
# some missing data which has already been cleaned.
#
# DataAnalytics-WorkingCopy.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook which is being used in this instance to evaluate the trans.mdb database
# as part of a data analytics project.
